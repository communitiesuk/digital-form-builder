# DLUHC Fork of Digital Form Builder

This respository contains the [DLUHC Fork](https://github.com/communitiesuk/digital-form-builder) of the [XGovFormBuilder](https://github.com/XGovFormBuilder/digital-form-builder).

General information for working with the form builder in DLUHC and getting your local workspace setup can be found [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/41124236/Working+with+the+form-builder)

# Builds and Deploys

Information on how the form-runner is built and deploy to AWS is contained [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/73695505/How+do+we+deploy+our+code+to+prod#Deploying-Form-Builder).

# Using a new version of the DLUHC fork

## Github build

Any push to any branch will build a docker image of the runner and tag it with the commit ID. On main, it will also tag with latest.

So to consume a docker image produced by this workflow, update the `Dockerfile` you are using to pull the tag produced by this workflow.

## Docker Compose

The form runner is part of the [fsd docker runner](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-docker-runner), so just build and run the form-runner through docker compose

    docker compose build form-runner
    docker compose up form-runner

# Workflow Files

More detail on the workflow for deploying form runner to AWS is available [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/73695505/How+do+we+deploy+our+code+to+prod#Deploying-Form-Builder)

## .github/workflows/main--lint-unit-build-and-publish-images.yml

**Disabled** This is the workflow used on the main branch of the original XGovFormBuilder repo. It does not apply to our workflow.

## .github/workflows/branch--lint-unit-and-smoke-test.yml

Runs against a branch that has an open pull request against it. It will execute on every push to such a branch to build and run smoke tests. Unchanged from upstream repo.

## ./github/workflows/increment-version.yml

- Triggered when a PR is opened (or re-opened)
- Finds the latest tag in the repo, increments the patch version of this, then updates [version](./version) with that new version
- eg. If the latest tag is `1.2.3`, `version` will be updated to `VERSION=1.2.4`
- This version is then used to tag the built image, as explained [above](#githubworkflowsdluhc-build-and-publishyml) and [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/73695505/How+do+we+deploy+our+code+to+prod#Build-the-DLUHC-Runner-Image)

## ./github/workflows/copilot_deploy.yml

- Deploys the form runner to AWS as per [this wiki page](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/73695505/How+do+we+deploy+our+code+to+prod#Build-and-deploy-the-Runner-Image)
- Uses the [FSD Dockerfile](./fsd_config/Dockerfile) to create a deployable docker image, then pushes this to AWS.

# Copilot Initialisation

Copilot is the deployment of the infrastructure configuration, which is all stored under the copilot folder. The manifest files have been pre-generated by running through various initialisation steps that create the manifest files by prompting a series of questions, but do not _deploy_ the infrastructure.

For each AWS account, these commands will need to be run _once_ to initialise the environment:

`copilot app init pre-award` - this links the pre-award app with the current service, and associates the next commands with the service. Essentially, this provides context for the service to run under

```
copilot init \
    --name fsd-form-runner \
    --app pre-award \
    --type 'Load Balanced Web Service' \
    --image "ghcr.io/${{github.repository_owner}}"/runner \
    --port 80
```

This will initalise this service, using the current created image
